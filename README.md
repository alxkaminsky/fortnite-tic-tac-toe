This is a tic tac toe game with a Fortnite theme, built with Java and JFrame. It is a final project for ICS3U at Country Day School by Alex Kaminsky.

The game allows you to play against an AI in single player mode or against another player in multiplayer mode. You can also choose from different Fortnite characters to represent your player icon.

## Getting Started
To play the game, simply run the TicTacToe.java file in your preferred Java IDE. You will be prompted to choose whether you want to play single player or multiplayer mode. If you choose single player mode, you will be able to select your character and play against the AI. If you choose multiplayer mode, you will be able to play against another player on the same device.

## Controls
To make a move, simply click on an empty square on the tic tac toe board. If you are playing multiplayer, take turns with the other player. If you are playing single player, the AI will automatically make its move after you make yours.

## Characters
The game features different Fortnite characters that you can choose to represent your player.
